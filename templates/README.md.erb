## Setup

```bash
$ bin/setup
```

## Git

By default, pre-commit hooks are setup to run `bin/rails`. To override this while committing pass the `--no-verify` option to your commit.

## Definition of Done

In addition to satisfying acceptance criteria, new functionality/changes/etc
must meet the following requirements before they can be considered "done":

1. Check all the boxes in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
1. Have received the :shipit: in peer review via Pull Request.

## Styleguide Enforcement

We run [rubocop][rubocop] with near vanilla configs to enforce the Ruby Community
Styleguide. It runs as part of the default `$ rake` task on CI or can be run on
its own with `$ rubocop`.
